# Heart-Disease-Project
My final project for data mining

Utilized Machine Learning to analyze patient data from five hospitals, identifying critical factors contributing to heart disease risk.
Applied PCA and Factor Analysis to reduce dataset dimensionality, isolating five key factor groups for further examination.
Developed Decision Tree models that achieved 87% accuracy in predicting heart disease presence among more than 900 patients.
